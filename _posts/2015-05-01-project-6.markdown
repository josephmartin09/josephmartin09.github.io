category: Web App Development
description: Mr. Perfetti is a subject matter expert in finance, business acumen, valuation and strategic planning. In addition to teaching in academic programs at Wharton, Maryland, Georgetown, and Emory, Mr. Perfetti has delivered over 1400 days of executive education over the past 25 years.  I developed a Ruby on Rails web app that allows Mr. Perfetti to present excel sheets containing financial data in a web-application that allows users to query the information in any manner that they choose. The application features a custom line+bar graph writen in D3.js, as well as an excel spreadsheet import system that seamlessly imports the raw financial data from an excel file, and adds it to a persistent data base.  This system is used by many of Perfetti's clients, which are some of today' leading tech companies and banks.
