description: Silver Palm LLC is a highly experienced signals intelligence and radio frequency company offering quality solutions to problems in the intelligence community.  Many of their modules involved the use of GNU-Radio, an open-source software defined radio system.  I helped port their C++ GNU-Radio modules to run the newly updated GNU-Radio 3.7 environment on Ubuntu 14. This code port saved them many man-hours that would have otherwise been required to re-develop the code from scratch.
